# Roadmap
- Reconsider the edit procedure in EditScreen (that problematically justifies Index)
  + Handle all editing cases in reducer and in database access

# Minor fixes
- WordDataReducer: DELETE_WORD -> SORTED_SCORES is an array of numbers, not objects
- Reposition the buttons in the app bar

## Medium priority
- Add filter for each word
- Add edit and edit buttons for each list item in WordListScreen

## Low priority
- Make the status bar's search input an expandable button (likely need some Animation).
- [List] Provide popup menu for each list item that allows quick access to Editing and Deleting.
