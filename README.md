# Roadmap
- Make all files Flow-compatible

## Medium priority
- Add filter for each word
- Add edit and edit buttons for each list item in WordListScreen

## Low priority
- Make the status bar's search input an expandable button (likely need some Animation).
- [List] Provide popup menu for each list item that allows quick access to Editing and Deleting.
